# Assembler for Custom Assembly Language

This is an assembler for a custom assembly language that translates assembly code into machine code. The assembler consists of several modules that work together to produce machine code files from assembly language files.

## Modules

The assembler consists of the following modules:

- `pre.c`: This module handles preprocessing of the assembly language file, including macro expansion and line numbering.

- `syntax.c`: This module handles syntax checking of the assembly language file, including checking for valid opcodes and operands.

- `first_pass.c`: This module performs the first pass of the assembly process, which generates a symbol table and calculates the memory addresses of labels.

- `second_pass.c`: This module performs the second pass of the assembly process, which generates the machine code and data images.

- `print_output.c`: This module handles printing the output files, including the machine code file, external data words file, and entry type symbols file.

- `main.c`: This module is the entry point for the assembler and coordinates the other modules to produce the output files.

## Usage

To use the assembler, you will need to provide it with an input file containing assembly code. The assembler will output several files, including a machine code file, an external data words file, and an entry type symbols file.

```bash
$ ./assembler input.asm
```
